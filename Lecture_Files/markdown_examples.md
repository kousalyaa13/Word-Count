### Links

Here are some handy links:

### Code blocks

Here's a block of code, for fancy display:

```python
# Use this:
with open(file_path, "r") as file_connection:
    file_contents = file_connection.read()

# NOT this:
file_connection = open(file_path, "r")
file_contents = file_connection.read()
file_connection.close()
```

### Tables



Note the colon on the right of the dashes ( ---: ) this makes that column align to the right.
